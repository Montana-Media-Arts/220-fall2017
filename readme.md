## COURSE OVERVIEW

This course is designed to teach code so that it can become a tool for art and creativity. This course furthers this goal by picking up where Creative Coding 1 (MART 120) leaves off.

The goal is to begin a journey in which the creative and technical possibilities of the computer become a tool in your palate. These tools will become an extension of you, something you think through, express yourself through, and can contribute to the world through. Ultimately, this course is designed to offer you a deeper understanding of the essential possibilities of computation.
